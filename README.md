#CodeWars

When I first started coding, I frequently found myself wondering why things worked the way 
they did, or why one method was preferred over another, beyond it requiring less code. This
repo is an attempt to answer some of those questions.

This is a list of various solutions to Katas (sorry codewars) that I've created with 
extensive comments for comparisons between novice solutions that work and expert solutions 
that incorporate best practices.

I'd like to know if these comments are helpful to others so please, raise issues or reach
out if you do or don't find them helpful. 

I'm always trying to improve.
